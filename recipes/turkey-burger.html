    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best turkey burger recipe. After making them the first time my husband said 'no more' to beef
        burgers. These are really good - any cooking method may be used, and they freeze very well. The recipe can also
        be used for meatballs or meatloaves.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds ground turkey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely diced onion</li>
        <li>2 egg whites, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix ground turkey, seasoned bread crumbs, onion, egg whites, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a
            large bowl.</li>
        <li>Form into 12 patties.</li>
        <li>Cook the patties in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning once, to an internal temperature of 180
            degrees F (85 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
